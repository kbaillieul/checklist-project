## Summary and Status

This project is the first React project I've created in the Get Coding program and is currently under development.

Users can also view previously completed checklists from local storage.

The user can click the View Completed Checklists button to view the checklists that have already been submitted and stored on local storage. Completed checklists indicate any high priority issues on submitted checklists. Users can expand accordian with the checklist date to get all the submitted information from the checklist.
