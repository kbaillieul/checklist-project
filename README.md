Summary and Status

This project is the first React project I've created in the Get Coding program and is currently under development. The goal of this project is to allow users to complete Fall Arrest Checklists, Light Vehicle Pre-Use Checklists, and Heavy Equipment Pre-Use Checklists. Users can also view previously completed checklists from local storage.

Overview

On load of the project, the user can select a checklist type from Fall Arrest, Light Vehicle Pre-Use, and Heavy Equipment Pre-Use.

The user can click the View Completed Checklists button to view the checklists that have already been submitted and stored on local storage. Completed checklists have bullet points that indicate any high priority issues indicated in the submitted checklists. Users can click the link with the checklist date to get all the submitted information from the checklist.
